## <u>Phase 1</u>

We are modelling and simulating random dispersion of mobile robots on graph with constraints.

## <u>Phase 2</u>

We are integrating [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=8/46.811/19.929) into our application so that we can visualize with the help of [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) library the robot dispersion more spectacularly.

## <u>Phase 3</u>

We mainly change our algorithm engine from Python to Java, due to the complexity of the different models. The main goal is to compare these dispersion models, so in this phase we strive for perfect algorithm simulations. The mentioned models originate from phases 1-2 and are expanded with dynamic graphs and different communication models.
