## <u>Phase 1</u>

We are modelling and simulating random dispersion of mobile robots on graph with constraints.

## <u>Phase 2</u>

We are integrating [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=8/46.811/19.929) into our application so that we can visualize with the help of [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) library the robot dispersion more spectacularly.
